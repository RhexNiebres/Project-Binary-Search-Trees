# Binary Search Tree Implementation

This repository contains a binary search tree (BST) implementation with various methods to manipulate and interact with the tree.

## Features

- **Balanced Binary Tree**: Automatically builds a balanced binary tree from a sorted array.
- **Insertion**: Insert a new node into the tree while maintaining the BST properties.
- **Deletion**: Delete a node from the tree and adjust the structure to maintain BST properties.
- **Traversals**: Supports level-order, pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals.
- **Balance Check**: Checks if the tree is balanced, based on the heights of subtrees.
- **Rebalance**: Rebalances the tree by creating a new balanced BST from the sorted node values.
- **Height and Depth**: Calculate the height of a tree and the depth of a specific node.
